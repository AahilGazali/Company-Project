# ðŸ¤– Excel AI Chat Feature

## Overview
The Excel AI Chat feature allows users to upload Excel files and ask natural language questions about their data using AI. The system automatically analyzes Excel file structure and provides intelligent responses about the data content.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### 1. **Excel File Upload & Analysis**
- User uploads Excel file (.xlsx, .xls) via DatabaseScreen
- System automatically analyzes file structure:
  - Extracts column names and data types
  - Identifies key fields (IDs, locations, dates, etc.)
  - Samples data for context
  - Generates data summary

### 2. **AI Chat Integration**
- Chat interface becomes data-aware after file upload
- AI can answer specific questions about the uploaded data
- Uses actual column names and sample values in responses

### 3. **Smart Question Handling**
The AI can handle questions like:
- **"What was the last action taken?"** â†’ References action/date columns
- **"How many MMTs were received for Location A?"** â†’ Filters by location and counts
- **"Show me data for the past month"** â†’ Uses date columns for filtering
- **"What locations are available?"** â†’ Lists unique location values
- **"Summarize the data for me"** â†’ Provides overview based on actual content

## ðŸ“Š Example Interaction

**User uploads:** `MMT Database.xlsx`

**AI Welcome Message:**
```
ðŸ“Š Excel data loaded! MMT Database.xlsx

Available Fields: Location, MMT_Count, Action_Type, Date_Received, Status

Sample Questions You Can Ask:
â€¢ How many records are in Sheet1?
â€¢ What locations are available in the data?
â€¢ How many MMTs were received?
â€¢ What was the last action taken?
â€¢ Show me data for a specific time period
â€¢ Summarize the data for me
```

**User asks:** "How many MMTs were received for Warehouse A in January?"

**AI Response:**
```
Based on your MMT Database.xlsx data, I can see you have the following relevant columns:
- Location (contains location names)
- MMT_Count (numeric data for MMT quantities) 
- Date_Received (date information)

From the sample data, I can see various locations including what appears to be warehouse locations. To find MMTs received for "Warehouse A" in January, I would look at:

1. Filter the Location column for "Warehouse A"
2. Filter Date_Received for January dates
3. Sum the MMT_Count values for those filtered records

From the sample data shown, I can see entries with MMT counts and location data, but I'd need you to specify which exact location name matches "Warehouse A" as it appears in your data.
```
